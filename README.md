### OddsShopper Sportsbook Arbitrage Scaprer
The above repository contains code to scrape arbitrage opportunities from OddsShopper's public sports-betting arbitrage page. It alerts the user with a sound when any new opportunities appear above a provided % ROI, and, given a total amount to put down, the program provides the respective wagers to place on the odds of each of the two sportsbooks.

Note: This is a scraper, and, therefore, it is functional so long as the host does not change the structure of their page's HTML. Thus, `oddsshopper.py` may no longer be functional upon download.
